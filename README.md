A repository holding contracting data, re-organized into the new [Open Contracting Data Standard](http://ocds.open-contracting.org/standard/r/master/)

The data was correct at the time of uploading, but should not be treated as an authoritive source of contracting data as the purpose of this repository is to investigate re-organizing existing contracting data into the open contracting data standard. As a result, **fields may have been misinterpreted and records may have become corrupted**. 

**Please return to the original data source for accurate contracting information from a specific publisher**.

Licenses

Each directory has it's own README documenting the data source. Please note that the data in each folder is licensed under the license of the original publisher, which is documented in the README in each folder.
